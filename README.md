# Personal-autounattend.xml
Personal autounattend.xml file for Windows Installation

Based off memstechtips/ChrisTitusTech publicly available code on Github.

Went through the whole code, modified it for my systems, and added some additional features to it such as additional settings, clearing files, hostname rename, username rename, apps install.


To use this unattend installation file, you should first create Windows installation media on a USB through the official tools. Then simply put the autounattend.xml file in the root directory of the USB so the Windows installer can read it.
